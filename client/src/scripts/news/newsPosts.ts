        Winter has arrived on the island, bringing the festive spirit of the season and two new guns with it.
        <br><br>Normal mode now has a frosty reskin for all assets and new presents that drop weapons, many of which can be found arranged under an outdoor Christmas tree. The <strong>Ice Pick</strong> also makes a return along with a new high-value <strong>Frozen Crate</strong> to use it on, although bullets and certain other melee weapons will work... eventually.

        <br><br>Exclusive to Harvest, the <strong>BLR</strong> is a brand new uncommon <strong>5.56mm DMR</strong> with a 5 round magazine, high damage, and moderate overall stats that rewards careful aim instead of blind spam.
        <br><br>The <strong>RGS sniper rifle</strong> has replaced the CZ-600 in the Red Tugboat, boasting a <strong>ten round</strong> magazine and overall improved stats from its predecessor while being chambered in the same caliber but unable to be found anywhere else in Classic mode. In Harvest mode, it can also be found in airdrops, River and Viking crates, and the gun lockers.
        <br><br>The <strong>Lewis Gun</strong> has received a major overhaul, boasting a faster fire rate, decreased movement penalties, and a more fairly sized sprite to make it less of a pain in combat.

        <br><br>Weekly rotating modes will begin on <strong>Sunday, December 15th at 8PM EST</strong>. Mode rotations <strong>will be adjusted in the future as needed and in response to community feedback</strong>.

        content: `Fall settles on a brand new mode, <strong>Harvest</strong>, bringing a plethora of <strong>new guns</strong>, a wide assortment of <strong>Perks</strong>, and the mysterious <strong>Plumpkins...</strong>

<br><br>Harvest is a large map filled with new trees, trails, and brand new ambient sounds and particles, as well as a bounty of new structures, including the <strong>Barns</strong>, old farming relics with plenty of cover, and the <strong>Lodge</strong>, a luxurious forest getaway with more than meets the eye...

<br><br>Deep underground, the <strong>Plumpkin Bunker</strong> has been uncovered. This monument of engineering and science contains everything from a fully stocked guard's quarters, to a warehouse, generator room, and the main labs themselves. Rumors have it that the experiments sealed inside the test chambers are highly enigmatic, but <strong>richly rewarding</strong> to anyone fortunate enough to lay hands on them. One of the samples seems to be sealed off... <strong>for now.</strong>

<br><br>Recent documents have revealed the <strong>Bombed Armory</strong>, containing the returning fan-favorite <strong>USAS-12</strong> sealed inside the vault, although getting inside might take a more <strong>brute force</strong> approach this time.

<br><br>Brand new weapon shipments to both Harvest and Normal mode include the <strong>SKS</strong>, a reliable and common DMR chambered in 7.62, although it leaves something to be desired in damage. The <strong>VKS Vykhlop</strong> has that more than covered, firing high damage suppressed .50 cal rounds at a low velocity. Finally, the monstrous <strong>Mk-18 Mjölnir</strong>, chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum, will rip through any competition with an impressive mixture of immense damage and fast fire rate.

<br><br>Unique to Harvest mode are two brand new shotguns, the <strong>DT-11</strong>, an under-over double barrel shotgun with longer range and lower damage compared to its sawed-off counterpart, and the <strong>M590M</strong>, a military pump-action shotgun firing high-explosive slugs.

<br><br>There's much more to check out, including new skins, a variety of small structures, brand new foliage, and changes yet to come.

          Good old-fashioned bureaucracy has made its way to the island with this update, alongside an overhaul of the highest tiers of ammo, two new melee weapons, and three new guns with impressive firepower.
          <br><br>Front and center, the massive <strong>AEGIS Headquarters</strong> has recently been completed. This titan of industry features two separate floors, a security office with an attached armory, a cafeteria, a boardroom, an executive office and lounge, and plenty of loot to make it worth your while. Rumor has it that the CEO even keeps a personal vault hidden somewhere in the building...
          <br><br>Two new handguns have been added: the <strong>DEagle</strong> and the <strong>RSh-12</strong>, both chambered in <strong>.50 Cal</strong>. The DEagle offers solid damage, high DPS, and a fair magazine size all in a compact package. On the other hand, the RSh-12 brings the term 'assault revolver' to life with <strong>powerful First Shot Accurate rounds</strong>, though it has low range and magazine capacity.
          <br><br>Due to a supply shortage, the Barrett M95 <strong>is no longer available</strong>. However, fear not; we've found an even more suitable replacement. The <strong>L115A1</strong>, chambered in <strong>the elusive .338 Lapua Magnum</strong>, is sure to turn heads (and pop them just as easily). Like its predecessor, the L115A1 is more than capable of engaging any opponent, regardless of armor.
          <br><br>There's much more to explore, including the <strong>Fire Hatchet</strong> and <strong>Falchion</strong> melees, overhauled Cargo Ship and Oil Tanker, brand new <strong>Blue House</strong>, and a few surprises coming in the near future.

        content: `Kongregate may have shut down Surviv Reloaded, but that's not gonna stop me! Today, I'm releasing the first ever beta version of Suroi, an open-source 2D battle royale game inspired by surviv.io.

        longContent: `<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>What is Suroi?</h3>
<p>Suroi is a new open-source 2D battle royale game inspired by surviv.io. After Surviv Reloaded, my first surviv.io revival project, got DMCA'd by Kongregate, the Surviv Reloaded team started work on a new game, Suroi. Suroi is similar to surviv, but it's built from the ground up with 100% original assets and code.</p>

<h3>Why isn't [feature] in the game yet? When will [feature] be added?</h3>
<p>The initial beta version of Suroi is very basic. Essential features like guns, loot, and buildings will be added in the next few weeks. For more information, check out the #roadmap channel on the Discord.</p>

<h3>I can't move.</h3>
<p>As the game is in early beta, we haven't added mobile controls yet. If you're on a mobile device, like a phone or tablet, there's no way to move yet.</p>

<h3>My game is laggy.</h3>
<p>The server is hosted in the United States. If you live far away from the US or you have slow Internet, lag is to be expected. In the future, servers will be hosted in other countries.</p>

<h3>I found a bug.</h3>
<p>To report a bug or suggest a feature, join the Discord. Post bugs in the #bugs channel, and suggestions in #suggestions. Before reporting a bug, please check to make sure someone else hasn't reported it already.</p>`
