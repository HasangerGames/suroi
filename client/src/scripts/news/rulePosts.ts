        <h2>No hacking!</h2>
        Hacking refers to the use of any game modifications or external software that might provide a competitive advantage, including but not limited to: aimbot, melee lock, visual assists, ESP, and exploiting glitches.
        <ul>
          <li>1st offense: 30 day ban</li>
          <li>2nd offense: Permanent ban</li>
        </ul>
        If you discover an exploit or vulnerability, please report it to the admins on the Discord server, or email support@suroi.io. You will not be banned unless you abuse it or tell others about it.

        <br><br>

        <h2>No teaming!</h2>
        Teaming is defined as helping another player who is not on your team.<br>
        This can include not attacking them, giving them items, helping them kill other players, and spamming positive emotes.
        <ul>
          <li>1st offense: Warning</li>
          <li>2nd offense: 24 hour ban</li>
          <li>3rd offense: 7 day ban</li>
          <li>4th offense: Permanent ban</li>

            <li>If you use a name that advertises hacks, you will be permanently banned.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>VPN/proxy policy</h2>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The goal of Suroi is to be the last player standing. You'll start with nothing, so move around the map to get weapons, scopes, armor, healing items, and ammo. If you see another player, eliminate them for their loot!</p>

<h2>Orange = Bad</h2>
<p>You have another enemy to watch out for: a deadly orange gas. The gas slowly fills the map as the game progresses, making the safe zone smaller and smaller. The damage increases each time it shrinks.</p>

<h2>Similar Games</h2>
<p>If you've played games like PUBG, Fortnite, and Apex Legends, or other browser battle royales like surviv.io and zombsroyale.io, you might be familiar with the concept of the game!</p>
