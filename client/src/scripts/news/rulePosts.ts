An advantage is anything that reveals information that would not be available to a normal player or anything that automates player actions.</li>
  <li><strong>No inappropriate usernames.</strong> Our blocklists are very lenient, but some words or phrases are still blocked. Trying to evade filters for these specific words will incur consequences.</li>
  <li><strong>No presence in cheat related servers.</strong> Attempting to "minimod" or "go undercover" in any cheat related servers is strictly prohibited and will get your discord, as well as your connection <strong>banned.</strong></li>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The goal of Suroi is to be the last player standing. You'll start with nothing, so move around the map to get weapons, scopes, armor, healing items, and ammo. If you see another player, eliminate them for their loot!</p>

<h2>Orange = Bad</h2>
<p>You have another enemy to watch out for: a deadly orange gas. The gas slowly fills the map as the game progresses, making the safe zone smaller and smaller. The damage increases each time it shrinks.</p>

<h2>Similar Games</h2>
<p>If you've played games like PUBG, Fortnite, and Apex Legends, or other browser battle royales like surviv.io and zombsroyale.io, you might be familiar with the concept of the game!</p>
