    ok so i'd use "::" as a namespace indicator, but doing
    so forces all enum access to be done as SomeEnum["Foo::Bar"].

    that sounds fine, but for some very strange reason, in the
    context of computed properties on interfaces/types,
    SomeEnum["ABC"] is not regarded as being a literal type,
    whereas SomeEnum.ABC is

    so we're forced to use "_" instead

    FIXME alsooooo the times when these events are fired are
    superrrrr inconsistentâ€”some happen after side effects,
    some before, some in the middle! either pick a single
    convention, or pick both before and after, splitting the
    events into "Will-" and "Did-" categories (ex: WillDoSomething
    and DidDoSomething; you'd expect the former to precede
    both the latter and any side effects)

    TODO add event cancelling (but only to events preceding
    side effects)?
